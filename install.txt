Hello all.
Are you jealousy about your friends having all the viewer with their msn spaces since they have that "shining star"?
Here is a plug-in for you to help you send a synchronization signal to your msn space, so that the star will flashing.
I recommand you to include your blogs URL in the synchronization message. For version 1.0, this plug-in will include a digest of the new posting you made on your blog. But for now,(before my finals) let's just leave it as the way it is


Installation note:
STEP 1. 
Enable your msn space for API posting.
Setup a MSN space if you don't have one.
Then goto options --> E-mail publishing
Under this menu, choose an e-mail (This doesn't matter)
Then choose a secret word (This will be the "password")

STEP 2.
Place the wp-msnspace.php into [wp-content/plugins] directory then simply activate it from your control panel.

STEP 3.
Go to admin panel, you'll see a new option called "msn sync", go in there and make the necessary setup, and you're done.
